# Exercise timer

Simple app that uses a looped timer to give you a hands-free tool for interval training. See the live demo [here](http://sebpearce.com/exercise/).

([Interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training) is a form of exercising in which a short period of exercise, or "work," is followed by a short period of rest, and then repeated.)

## Usage

You need to enter three pieces of information:

a. number of seconds of work/exercise  
b. number of seconds of rest  
c. number of repetitions/sets

in the format `a/b/c`.

For example, entering `10/5/20` will give you 20 sets, with each set consisting of 10 seconds of work followed by 5 seconds of rest.
